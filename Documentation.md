# Spring Constant
The spring constant, denoted as "**k**," is a fundamental property of a spring that quantifies its stiffness or rigidity. It defines the relationship between the force applied to a spring and the amount of deformation (either compression or extension) the spring undergoes in response to that force. In mathematical terms, the spring constant is described by Hooke's Law:
$$F = -kx$$
Where:
- F represents the force applied to the spring, measured in Newtons (N).
- k is the spring constant, measured in Newtons per meter (N/m).
- x is the deformation or displacement of the spring from its equilibrium position, measured in meters (m).

The negative sign indicates that the force exerted by the spring is in the opposite direction of the displacement.
